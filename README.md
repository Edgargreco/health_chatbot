This project report presents the development and implementation of HealthBot Uganda, an AI-powered health information chatbot designed to bridge the gap in healthcare information access for Ugandan communities. The system addresses the critical challenge of limited access to reliable health information, particularly in underserved areas where healthcare resources are scarce.
HealthBot Uganda leverages artificial intelligence, specifically natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, to provide instant, accurate, and contextually relevant health information to users. The chatbot supports English, Luganda, Runyankore-Rukiga, Ateso, Luo, Acholi, Langi, Lugbara, and Swahili languages, making it accessible to a broader population segment. Key functionalities include symptom assessment, emergency response guidance, disease information, health tips, and healthcare facility location services. The chatbot operates 24/7 through a responsive web interface optimized for mobile devices, ensuring accessibility across different technological capabilities. Security measures protect user privacy and data integrity throughout interactions.
The methodology employed a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative interviews, observational studies, and quantitative surveys with 50 participants from Wakiso District. The system was developed using Botpress as the core chatbot framework, integrated with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface, and Node.js for backend processing.
Results indicate that 88% of users found the system easy to use, with 70% preferring to interact in Luganda. The most popular features were symptom checking and emergency guidance. User feedback highlighted the system's potential to improve health decision-making in communities with limited healthcare access.
This project contributes to Uganda's digital health initiatives and demonstrates the potential of AI-powered solutions in addressing healthcare challenges in developing countries. The system serves as a foundation for future enhancements and scalability to other regions and languages.
